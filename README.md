## Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This notebook uses various python machine learning tools to build a model that predicts the susceptibility of a person
having a heart disease using their medical records as reference

The framework we've used:
1. Problem Definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

## Data

Original Data is from UCI Machine Learning - [Heart-Disease-Dataset]('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease')
